   * Atmospheric refraction in astronomy, refers to the bending of light as it passes through the Earth's

   *
   * Actual Position: Due to this bending of light, the apparent position of a celestial object is slightly
   * different from its true position in the sky. When a star or planet is near the horizon, the effect is more
   * pronounced because the light path passes through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which increases the amount of
   * bending.
   *
   * A familiar example of atmospheric refraction is observed during sunrise and sunset. The Sun appears to
   * be above the horizon when it is actually just below it. This is because the light from the Sun is bent
   * upwards as it passes through the atmosphere.
